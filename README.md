#Auto MCQ Generator using LangChain, Groq API (LLaMA-3), and Flask

#Project Overview:
Developed a full-stack AI-powered web application that automatically generates Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) from uploaded documents using LangChain and Groq‚Äôs LLaMA-3 models. This solution is designed to assist educators, trainers, content creators, and e-learning platforms by turning raw educational materials into quizzes and assessments within seconds.

# Frontend & Integration (Flask Web Interface)

Drag & Drop Upload for .pdf, .docx, and .txt files.
